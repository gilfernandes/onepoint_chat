,What do you consider to be your Company's unique strengths? How can these strengths provide the best services for CBRE?,"Through testimonials and feedback from clients, we have found that enterprise clients like CBRE value five key aspects of Onepoint:
1. Enterprise-grade, yet boutique — Finding smaller, agile suppliers that can effectively operate within an enterprise context, bring innovative ideas, collaborate with much larger suppliers, and maintain a steadfast focus on delivering digital business outcomes of the enterprise can be challenging for companies like CBRE.
2. Unrelenting focus on delivering value — ‘Delivering value in everything we do’ is a foundational principle of Onepoint. We incorporate this into every aspect of the Onepoint business, from our commercial propositions to our approaches and methods. 
3. ‘A’ team every time — Unlike larger suppliers, Onepoint’s highly-experienced and close-knit team means that your core team from Onepoint is involved from sales through to delivery. We do not believe in ‘bait and switch’ practices
4. Relationships of trust — A driving principle of Onepoint is to deliver value in everything we do. By leveraging our unique combination of human, business, and technical expertise, we establish relationships of trust with clients like CBRE. 
5. Purpose beyond profit — Unlike many organisations that use purpose as a public relations or box-ticking exercise, Onepoint was built-on social good and ethics from its first day of existence.
Our founding team met through charity projects they worked on together. They decided to build a different kind of technology consultancy that had social responsibility at its core. 
Onepoint’s active involvement in charitable causes and societal good enhances the company’s employer brand, allowing us to attract and retain talent in highly competitive fields of digital, data, analytics, and advanced technology."

,What type of work or service is typically performed by the Management Staff who are direct employees of your company?,"Capabilities and activities by management staff that are client delivery focused include: Technology Architecture and Delivery, Project Management, Account Management, Partner Management, Managed Services Management, Information Security and Service Delivery, and Quality Assurance.

Capabilities and activities by management staff that are primarily internally-focused include: Business Strategy, Governance, Talent Management, Business Development, Finance, and Information Governance and Risk."
,Who are your two (2) largest competitors?,"The nearest competitors that we have come across in the scope covered by the CBRE RFP are NeosAlpha and Datalytyx. As far as larger competitors, we have won work in procurement exercises against many larger systems integrators and consultancies, including Deloitte, Sapient, Virtusa, and Wipro. We do not consider any one (or two) of them to be our direct competitors on every opportunity we pursue.

We have competed against — and collaborated with — most organisations on digital client projects, including Accenture, ANDigital, Deloitte, EY, IBM, Infosys, KPMG, Tech Mahindra, TCS, Wipro and various innovation agencies."
,What separates your company from your competitors in question 1.15?,"We believe that our unique strengths — as described in our answer to question 1.4 — are also our competitive differentiators. 

Our five key strengths (or superpowers) are: 1) Enterprise-grade, yet boutique; 2) unrelenting focus on delivering value; 3) ‘A’ team every time; 4) relationships of trust; and 5) purpose beyond profit. 

In a field where most competitor organisations attempt to differentiate themselves through similar messaging, we believe that our unique strengths — and our authentic focus on delivering superior value to clients and continually striving to improve how we do that — set us apart."
,What are your company's biggest weaknesses?,"Onepoint has a long-track record of delivering successful outcomes to global enterprise clients on enterprise-grade, transformational initiatives. Small and medium sized businesses (SMBs) can face challenges when competing for opportunities for enterprise-scale work. Onepoint has overcome these potential weaknesses by:
- Defining and applying approaches and methods to de-risk the decision to choose us;

- Building a track record of successful delivery to FTSE 100 / Fortune 500 / Global 1000 enterprises, including testimonials and references; 

- Forming strong partner relationships and consistently demonstrating the ability to quickly learn and innovate with new technologies; and 

- Rapidly scaling up our team to deliver to client needs by attracting talent through a focus on developing an attractive employee value proposition and employer brand.

Onepint has a strong bias to delivery excellence. This means much of our organisational DNA is geared to delivery rather than business development. This reduced sales focus can be a weakness when establishing formal partnerships with large technology platforms, such as Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services. Although we are highly experienced and have delivered exceptional outcomes for clients on these platforms, the inability to meet onerous demands of new sales / net new revenue placed by these vendors can be a weakness for a boutique consultancy such as Onepoint."

,"Do you have any initiatives in place that support disadvantage or marginalised groups in the community?

If yes, please give brief description","Yes, Onepoint’s founder, Shashin Shah, came to the UK in 1971. The government of Idi Amin had expelled all ethnic Asians from Uganda. Shashin saw at first hand the challenges ethnic minority groups can face in any part of the world. 

That experience shaped Shashin’s worldview. He ensured that contributing to society would become part of Onepoint’s core DNA.

Since its first day of operation in 2005, Onepoint has contributed to society in multiple ways, including taking on apprentices and interns in the UK and India, providing work experience to school children, and taking on refugees. 

Onepoint currently has two interns in the UK, who are both from minority ethnic groups. Previous interns and apprentices have been from both minority and majority groups, as we believe in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) of all forms.

We employ two refugees with origins in Afghanistan and Iran, who are now based in Greece and Germany. 

We chose to employ a number of people who are transitioning into an IT career in our recently (February 2023) launched Manchester office, giving them opportunities to level-up. 

Onepoint provides pro bono technology and data services and support to various charities and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). 

The company has also helped develop two wellbeing apps, Happidote and Beezone that put mental health awareness at the forefront.
We care about mindfulness and wellbeing so much that we even made public one of our internal practices. During the difficult times of the pandemic, Onepoint launched fortnightly public ‘yoga for the mind’ guided meditation sessions called Onepoint Oneness, which are streamed live on YouTube. These sessions continue to this day, having gone past 100 episodes in 2022. The library of previous Oneness sessions are available to view on-demand on YouTube."

Our QA approach in general is presented in detail below, For the CBRE projects at a high level we propose the following main quality assurance steps:
• Robust quality driven project and scrum management approach
• Peer reviews of Architecture / High Level Design / Detailed Designs to ensure alignment to the functional and quality requirements
• Ensuring no-ambiguity and common understanding of CBRE requirements through requirements review and documented acceptance criteria for each requirements
• Perform code-walkthroughs via peer reviews to ensure code alignment to design, best practice adoption and assure code quality
• Adopt test driven development and test for functional and non-functional requirements to identify defects earlier
• Peer reviews of unit test cases to ensure comprehensive code coverage

Onepoint QA Approach
Onepoint QA is to ensure providing business value and at the same time delivering quality work to CBRE. Our QA is a systematic approach consisting of processes, procedures, techniques, and standards for ensuring the: 
• Quality of services provided / deliverables created by the Onepoint team 
• Application of best practices and techniques that minimise risks to quality, schedule, and budget 
• Delivery of consistent results in terms of quality, schedule, and budget across multiple services 
• Comprehension of stakeholder expectations, with a clearly outlined approach to meet those expectations 
• To ensure services provide business value, meet CBRE expectations and quality deliverables are delivered to the client.
The key team members we have proposed for this project typically have 10+ years’ experience; their in-depth experience is critical to maintain quality."
,"At an organisational level, what measurements do you use to determine quality?","Quality measures are implemented by independent QA team (not part of the development team) across the organization. Using a shift left approach QA team is included from initial stages of the project ensuring quality from the requirement upto the final deliverable. The measures of Quality used are -
- Code Quality
- Test Coverage
- Reliability 
- Performance / Availability
- Usability 
- Security 
- Productivity
- User satisfaction surveys"
,"At a project level, what tools do you use to determine quality assurance standards?","Burndown Charts, Requirment Tracebility Matrix, Test Coverage, Code Quality Tools ( SonarQube), etc."
,What is the process by which quality is designed and built into your services?,"- Requirement validation process
- Architecture validation process
- Development validation process (required for deployment in UAT/Pre-Prod)"
,"Does your company have any quality certifications? If yes, please provide details by country.",No
,How do you determine customer satisfaction for your services?,"Onepoint strives to do continuous improvement of its service through periodic customer feedback.Our biggest indicator of customer satisfaction is repeat business and longevity of engagement. We reach out to client to measure their satisfaction as below: 
C-suite engagement (Ongoing, periodic verbal and direct feedback) - CEO organises regular and periodic calls with senior client stakeholders to obtain verbal feedback of the performance of project team and deliverables.(Eg: Meggitt, Moto)
Ongoing feedback - We invite our clients to sprint retrospectives to raise and address any concerns as they are identified.
Retrospective and written feedback - Onepoint invites clients to share retrospective feedback on project completion in the form of testimonials."
,"At a project level, what documentation standards do you produce for quality control?","From QA prespective:
- High level test strategy
- Detailed test plans
- Test scenarios
- Test cases
- Requirement traceability matrix
- Bug reports
- Test execution reports (These can be maintained in Test Management Tool like ALM, Devops, Jira etc)"
,"Describe how you manage NFR testing - performance and test security (stress, load, volume)","Performance engineering approach drives us to engineer performance and scalability during the architecture and design stage not after performance testing when it will be expensive and time consuming to fix any design anomalies. If required to ensure correct approach, we carry out proof of concept design to remove any potential areas of uncertainty. 
Performance engineering relies on the following activities that form the basis of a methodology: 
- Identify the key factors that will determine a system’s performance; 
- Measure the system and understand its workload (when it exists); 
- Develop and validate a workload model that captures the key characteristics of the actual workload; 
- Develop and validate an analytical model that accurately predicts the performance of the system; 
- Use the model (s) to predict and optimise the performance of the system. 
Performance testing is done based on non-function requirements to ensure specified performance criteria are met. 
Testing is usually separated in synthetic tests that are emulating load on specific component (For example for web app: page rendering, API response) and experience test that will measure time for page to load in browser. We may conduct following tests (depending on NFRs): 
- Load testing 
- Stress testing 
- Endurance testing 
- Spike testing 
- Volume testing 
- Scalability testing 

Relevant tools will be selected for each test based on the requirements Similar approach is taken for Security - in addition to security by design and gate reviews, test will cover relevant areas. For System Security, internal access control, row level security, security features defined in the requirements w.r.t internal systems are covered. However security testing such as testing 3rd party software packages, threat analysis, vulnerability, DDOS attacks etc., are covered by an external intependent party to ensure unbiased results."
,Share your experience of delivering outcomes with TDD and BDD approaches,"We used this as unit testing in our in-house projects, writing the testing before implementation, including tests using natual language (based on cucumber)"
,Describe your company's innovation strategy and how it drives growth,"Within our Onepoint Research banner, Our CTO, Alexander (Sasha) Polev, leads a team of architects to continuously track and monitor emerging and evolving technologies in the open source, application development, data management, systems integration, and cloud landscape. Once we identify technologies that we feel can drive improved value generation for our clients and our colleagues, we use our Valuepath™ approach to carry out internal PoCs (proof of concepts) to gain deeper insight and experience.

Our team also participates in open competitions (such as Kaggle) to test our learnings with a broader group of stakeholders. Over the course of our existence, we have used this approach to develop capabilities in AI / ML, Big / Fast Data, Kubernetes, cloud based data architectures, ETL / ELT and IPaaS. 

This research, experimentation, and continuous innovation has led us to add decisive value to major projects for our clients using Talend, Boomi, Mulesoft, Node.js, and Snowflake on AWS and Azure.

A case study on one of our complex data engagements, ""06 Onepoint - Reaching for the Skies (Client Story).pdf"", which has been uploaded to Zycus, describes how our continuous innovation contributed to achieving the client’s digital business outcomes."
,How does your company measure the success of its innovation efforts?,"We use a combination of measures to consider the success of our innovation efforts. Some indicators are:
1. Reduced time to outcome for our clients;
2. Reduced cost to our clients;
3. Enhancing or building new strategic partnerships with technology vendors;
4. Building long term partnerships with our clients; and
5. Staff satisfaction, personal growth, and retention.

Most importantly, we value what clients say about the innovative contributions we make:

“Onepoint challenges obvious solutions, instead striving to deliver a solution that puts you ahead of the competition.” — Mark Stier, former Enterprise Architect at TUI Group, one of the world’s leading leisure, travel, and tourism companies."
,"Can you discuss any partnerships, collaborations, or acquisitions that have helped drive innovation at your company?","Yes, We work closely with our strategic partners to develop tailored innovative solutions for clients. We have applied our Valuepath™ approach in collaboration with technology partners such as Boomi, Snowflake, Talend, and Quickbase to identify and develop innovative solutions for clients such as Moto Hospitality and Lightsourcebp."
,How does your company gather client feedback and incorporate it into your innovation efforts?,"As part of our Valuepath™ approach, we help clients to establish the true business value of innovative solutions or approaches by building a solid business case. 

This close working with end clients, typically with co-investment from Onepoint, naturally garners meaningful client feedback, as illustrated by the quote by Mark Stier mentioned in our answer to question 5.2."
,What steps is your company taking to stay on the cutting edge of technology and industry trends?,"Onepoint’s people are curious, lifelong learners, and always on the lookout for better ways of doing things. This naturally leads to an innovation mindset, in technology as well as other aspects. They stay abreast of what’s going on (e.g. through newsletter and alerts) and actively share learnings internally through Onepoint Fuse, our regular company-wide knowledge sharing sessions, internal chat forums (e.g. on Discord), personal blogging (e.g. on LinkedIn), and ad hoc ‘watercooler’ conversations.

Participating in industry exhibitions, online communities, and partner exchanges allow Onepoint to be on cutting edge in areas important to our clients. Additionally, Each Centre of Excellence is constantly on the lookout for practices and tools that will allow us bring greater value to clients by applying emerging technologies."
,How does your company foster a culture of innovation and support employee ideas and creativity?,"Our colleagues are part of Self Managing Teams focused on areas of strategic importance to the company. They can freely exchange ideas, conduct internal PoCs, and shape the technical strategy of the company. 
As illustrated in the response to question 5.5, a culture of innovation thrives at Onepoint."
,Describe how you typically evaluate the complexity of your projects and manage resources to estimate project requirements and risks?,"We evaluate complexity based on a number factors:
- High level requirements
- Technology stack, number of components and systems
- Scope, defined by the number and type of deliverables

Based on the above we typically identify the project's critical path and timelines, which in turn is used to define the resourcing profile and identify risks. Similar projects implemented before are often used as a reference."
,Do you have experience with project management tools and Agile software development (Scrum/Kanban)? Can you provide any case study examples?,"Yes, Onepoint has delivered projects using both waterfall and agile methodologies. More recent projects have been delivered using Agile scrum.
We leverage functionality from a wide variety of tools and platforms to aid project managers including:
- MS Project
- Jira (Kanban board)
- Azure devops board (Agile Scrum)
- Project reports and dashboards (including RAG status)
- Timesheets (Zoho People)
- Resource planning (runn.io)
- Smartsheets and Google sheets (Change management/Change Request tracking)
- SharePoint, DropBox, Confluence (Collaboration and document sharing)
- Google groups, Discord channels, Teams (Communication)
- Stakeholder mapping (Agile DSDM)
- RACI matrix

Our client case study document ""07 Onepoint - Helping SolarCo to Scale.pdf"" has been delivered using Agile scrum.

Tracking and ensuring timely project delivery (example based on Agile Scrum project)
Pre-sprint planning: Bi-weekly meeting with clients to ensure a healthy backlog is maintained and prioritised to feed upcoming sprints based on overall project timelines.
Nailing down definition of User stries/PBI Readiness: One key requirement is to ensure requirements and acceptance criteria fully documented, tasks are broken down and estimated, dependencies met, before they are marked “ready” for a sprint.
Sprint capacity calculated accurately factoring in team holidays. Usually 80% of capacity for tasks leaving 20% for generic activities including meetings.
Daily stand ups to track progress suing sprint burndown chart.
Sprint review and retrospective to ensure project aligned to business stakeholders expectation and processes are continuously improved."
,How do you maintain and develop the skills of your Development teams?,"Yes, we believe that maintaining and eveloping the skills of our teams is critical to the (long-term) success of any project and ultimately our organisation.
Our strategy for this is:
- To identify any skills gaps by regulary assessing team members on their knowledge and expertise.
- New joiners are typically assigned a mentor, pairing them with more experienced colleagues who can help them develop new skills and gain valuable insights into the industry.
- We offer training and development programs to all our employees. We have several employees that are part of an apprenticeship. In fact, several of our employees will enroll in an apprenticeship offered by CBRE. In addition team members are regularly required to complete training and certification for technologies used in their assigned projects.
- Within Onepoint we have a culture of learning and encourage everyone to take on opportunities that can help them develop new skills and make sure that everyone has access to learning resources. As part of this culture, we regularly organise ""Fuse"" sessions where people can share knowledge on new technologies or subjects they are passionate about.
- We encourage our teams to participate in emerging areas such as AL/ML by engaging on Kaggle projects"
,Do you have a technical expertise branch or center of excellence/innovation for Software and Data Engineering? How do they help increase pace of Delivery?,"Yes, we have SMTs (Self managing teams) and project teams that develop or different centre of excellence guided by our overall technical strategy. We use our experience and vendor best practices to define common patterns and create re-useable assets to speed up and reduce errors in delivery."
,How does your company ensure consistent standards are maintained throughout different services?,"We recognise that ensuring consistent standards is essential for maintaining quality and efficiency and do this in the following ways:
- Each technology often has their own standards and best practices defined. We are very diligent in adhering to these standards and best practices for the technologies we use.
- The above often includes a set of coding standards and best practices that all of our developers follow. This generally includes guidelines for naming conventions, coding style, use of libraries and frameworks.
- We typically embed code reviews into our standard development practices to ensure the code meets the established coding standards and best practices.
- As part of the project onboarding we provide all developer with necessary training and documentation to ensure that they understand and follow the established standards and best practices."
,Have you previously delivered Data Platform projects? Can you provide any case study examples? What were the key challenges faced and how they were addressed?,"Yes, we have provided two client case studies; please refer to:
- ""06 Onepoint - Reaching for the Skies (Client Story).pdf""
- ""07 Onepoint - Helping SolarCo to Scale.pdf"""
,"Is your company a Snowflake service partner? What tier is it - ""Elite"" or ""Premier"" or ""Select""?",Select
,"Tell us about your capabilities and expertise in the following areas:
• Automated testing/deployment
• Performance and load examination
• Technical documentation
• Continuous integration
• Security check-up","Depends on the technology. For example using Java as backend and React as a frontend, we have continous integration using automatic testing based on cucumber (easy to any BA to code tests against), and automatic deployments in case of test success. We use design docs as technical documention for solving challenging problems (including Security preventions). We also use JavaDocs and JsDocs to document code/apis/etc. Performance testing are done using JMeter."
,"Do you have a strong partnership with the world's top Cloud providers - AWS, Azure, GCP?","No, we have basic partnerships in place, we have extensive experience of AWS and Azure and have done some big data benchmarking on GCP"
,How long (duration in weeks) does a typical Product Discovery take and what roles are involved in this?,"6 - 12 weeks involving a lead PM / scrum master, business / systems analyst, architect, UI/UX resources"
,Have you previously delivered Data Provision end to end from a Datawarehouse and DataLake? What use cases did it solve?,"Yes, we have provided a client case study, please refer to:
- ""07 Onepoint - Helping SolarCo to Scale.pdf"""
,How does your company's technology improve the ease and reliability of data?,We support variety of tools in data management space and will select best tool for each specific use case. Ease and reliablilty of data is major factor in selecting the right technology. When client has already selected tools/technologies for the project we ensure ease of use and reliability features of the technologies are used to the fullest.
,How do you minimize attrition of staff and maximize business continuity?,"Having worked with top systems integration and management consultancy firms, the founding team of Onepoint brought decades of experience to the creation of Onepoint in 2005. Fundamental to this was a vision of building a very different kind of consulting firm that would be open, transparent, always ethical and honest, and focused on delivering value in our entire ecosystem, in addition to clients. This ecosystem includes our colleagues, partners, charities / NGOs, and broader communities around us.

This vision has created a values and value-driven culture that carries onto this day. It also helps us to ‘live’ our employer brand, which attracts people who want to join our mission and stay (and grow) with us for the long haul. 
Our colleagues are paid market rates. In addition, they have ample career development, a flat management hierarchy, and an array of benefits including medical care, dental care, life assurance cover and income protection. The fuller employee value proposition is summarised on page 8 of “09 Onepoint - Careers @ Onepoint (Recruitment Pack).pdf”, which has been uploaded to Zycus. 
Onepoint strives to allow each individual to be who they are and to find opportunities that best match their personal ambitions and development needs. Onepoint’s founding team continues to use great resolve to ensure we preserve a reasonable and sustainable life / work balance. This is why we prefer to grow the business organically, driven by client demand, rather than driven by aggressive financial targets. See comments as well.

We have grown headcount in 2022 and so far in 2023 based on additional work coming from our existing and new clients. We opened a regional UK office in Manchester in February 2023 to further diversify the talent pool and add more capability (see “08 Manchester Calling.pdf” on Zycas uploads, which gives more information on our expansion to Manchester.) 
Onepoint’s culture of caring and sharing means that any toxic behaviour is not tolerated. Together, all of this creates a workplace culture that is inviting and leads to long term commitment. Onepoint’s core team has been together for nearly two decades. 

Our employee retention and satisfaction rates are vastly higher than the industry average for the UK and in India. This means that clients like CBRE get business continuity and access to exceptional, committed talent. As we described in our answer to question 1.4, talent is one of our five core strengths and competitive advantages. 
We have a value-based culture; we also offer top tier benefits (physical and mental health cover for staff and family) and offer sabbaticals and other work/life balance. Our business continuity plan is contingency based with provisions for short, medium and long term cover."

,What’s unique about Onepoint’s approach to digital initiatives?,"Demonstrating alignment between digital solution choices with strategic priorities
and operational outcomes can be a challenging task for both business and technology
leaders. This is where Onepoint excels.
Applying the team’s decades-long experience, Onepoint developed an approach that
is now proven at dozens of enterprise clients. The Onepoint ValuepathTM Proof of
Value approach is a rapid selection and validation exercise that expedites the decision
path for technology choices. Within just 2-6 weeks, Onepoint provides clients with
independent conclusions and proof points, enabling them to confidently take on
digital experiments and implementations.
Onepoint’s ValuepathTM approach has three main stages. First, Onepoint’s consultants
arrange a Discovery Call to explore the client’s challenges. This also allows Onepoint
to share initial ideas on potential digital opportunities.
Next, Onepoint hosts a Springboard WorkshopTM that brings stakeholders from
different parts of the client’s business to brainstorm and discuss possible successful
outcomes, using cases and research. This not only gets business and technology
stakeholders involved early, it also starts to build a collaborative mindset very early in
the client’s digital journey.
Finally, Onepoint delivers a technical prototype accompanied by a ValuepathTM report,
presenting the Proof of Value required to further the client’s initiative. Typically this
stage is completed within 2 to 6 weeks, depending on the complexity of the use case
being tackled.
This rapid value delivery sets Onepoint a class above, as the teams work cohesively to
ensure that your business value is maximised."

,"What do you consider to be your Company's
unique strengths? How can these strengths
provide the best services for CBRE?","Enterprise-grade, yet boutique

Finding smaller, agile suppliers that can effectively
operate within an enterprise context, bring
innovative ideas, collaborate with much larger
suppliers, and maintain a steadfast focus on
delivering digital business outcomes of the
enterprise can be challenging for companies like
CBRE.

However, Onepoint boasts over 15 years of experience
accomplishing precisely this with FTSE 100 / Fortune 500 / Global
1000 clients. Onepoint's senior leadership and broader team
possess decades of varied enterprise IT services experience gained
from prominent consultancies and systems integrators worldwide.

Unrelenting focus on delivering value

‘Delivering value in everything we do’ is a
foundational principle of Onepoint. We incorporate
this into every aspect of the Onepoint business,
from our commercial propositions to our
approaches and methods.

Our commercial proposition brings our clients world-class, high
calibre digital, data, analytics, and advanced technology expertise
at reasonable rates. Our fee rates are achieved through blending
UK-based expertise with our own technology talent in Pune, India.
To address client needs, we are currently in early stages of
planning for a potential second offshore centre in Colombo, Sri
Lanka, which will further contribute to our commercial value
proposition.

Our Rapid Value MethodTM and ValuepathTM approach are designed to deliver early value in our engagements. ValuepathTM is a rapid prototyping approach that allows clients to ‘start small’ with proof-
of-concept and proof-of-value exercises. This allows clients to

experience Onepoint’s capabilities, working style, and value
delivery upfront.

‘A’ team every time

Unlike larger suppliers, Onepoint’s highly-
experienced and close-knit team means that your

core team from Onepoint is involved from sales
through to delivery. We do not believe in ‘bait and
switch’ practices.

Our senior management time is disproportionately focused on
ensuring that we are delivering value to our clients in every
advisory and delivery engagement and managed services contract.
More than one individual from the senior management team of
Onepoint is involved in every client account, with close
involvement of our Founder and CEO, to ensure ongoing client
satisfaction and value delivery.

Onepoint’s core team has been together for nearly two decades.
Our employee retention and satisfaction rates are vastly higher than the industry average for the UK and in India. We have also
been growing headcount in 2022 and so far in 2023, and have
structured onboarding, development, and mentoring programmes
as part of our comprehensive employee value proposition to help
our talent thrive.

Relationships of trust

A driving principle of Onepoint is to deliver value in
everything we do. By leveraging our unique
combination of human, business, and technical
expertise, we establish relationships of trust with
clients like CBRE.

We are committed to transparency and honesty and have no
qualms about admitting when we lack the necessary in-house
capabilities to fulfil a specific request. We will work with others to
deliver any gaps, we will not pretend, and we will not ‘train’ our
resources at your expense.

We prioritise recommending the most suitable solutions for our
clients, independently and without constraint from any formal
partnerships. This client-focused approach has proven to be
effective, with nearly all of Onepoint’s net new business coming
through referrals from satisfied clients and partners.

Purpose beyond profit

Unlike many organisations that use purpose as a
public relations or box-ticking exercise, Onepoint
was built on social good and ethics from its first day
of existence.

Our founding team met through charity projects they worked on
together. They decided to build a different kind of technology
consultancy that had social responsibility at its core.

Onepoint’s active involvement in charitable causes and societal
good enhances the company’s employer brand, allowing us to
attract and retain talent in highly competitive fields of digital, data,
analytics, and advanced technology."
